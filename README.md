# Employee Management App

Welcome to the Employee Management App! This is a React project built using Create React App. This README will guide you through the installation process and provide information about how to start the project locally. You can also check out the live demo of the app deployed on Netlify.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the Employee Management App here: [Employee Management App Demo](https://main--emp-mgmt-app.netlify.app/)

## Installation

Before running the app locally, you need to install its dependencies. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm) installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham-shri/emp-mgmt-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd emp-mgmt-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   If you prefer npm, you can use the following command instead:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server and run the app locally. Follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   Or, with npm:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Your default web browser should automatically open, and you will see the Employee Management App running locally.

3. You can now interact with the app, upload Employee CSV, search Employees, sort employees etc.
